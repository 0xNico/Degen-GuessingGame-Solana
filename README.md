# Degen-GuessingGame-Solana
 Guessing game with ratio based leverage built on the Solana blockchain. Very simple CLI based currently working on Testnet/Devnet. Feel free to build a UI interface for this application requiring a nominal protocol fee. This example was built as part of a potential feature for 'Anons' of the [888 Anon Clubᵀᴹ](https://888anon.xyz/)
